# Hi, I'm Izabela 👋 

I'm passionate about software engineering and enjoy coding and developing my skills in Python programming language through projects.

## About Me

I am dedicated to contribute my emerging expertise and skills in Python to engange in open-source projects as well as produce my own portfolio of projects.
My journey in coding has equipped me with valuable skills with a focus on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) as well as creativity and problem-solving to
all tasks. I am always eager to learn and adapt to new challenges.

## 🚀 Projects

1. **Capstone Project - Task Manager**
   - **Description:**

         displaying statistics. Additionally, the application supports user registration and login functionalities.
      - This python project demonstrates my skills so far learned during my software engineering bootcamp including functions, lists, dictionaries, opening files, creating menu options, error 
          handling and creating a user-friendly experience.
